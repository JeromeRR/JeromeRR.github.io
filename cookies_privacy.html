            <h1 class="doc-title">MossLand’s Use of Cookies</h1>

            <p>MossLand’s websites and online services may use “cookies.” Cookies enable you to use shopping carts and to personalize your experience on our sites, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, help us measure the effectiveness of ads and web searches, and give us insights into user behavior so we can improve our communications and products.</p>

            <p>If you want to disable cookies in the Safari web browser, go to Preferences and then to the Privacy pane and choose to block cookies. On your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch, go to Settings, then Safari, and then to the Cookies section. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.</p>

            <p>Because cookies are used throughout our websites, disabling them may prevent you from using certain parts of the sites.</p>

            <p>The cookies used on our websites have been categorized based on the guidelines found in the ICC UK Cookie guide. We use the following categories on our websites and other online services:</p>

            <h2>Category 1 — Strictly Necessary Cookies</h2>
            <p>These cookies are essential to enable you to browse around our websites and use their features. Without these cookies, services like shopping baskets and e-billing cannot be provided.</p>

            <h2>Category 2 — Performance Cookies</h2>
            <p>These cookies collect information about how you use our websites — for instance, which pages you go to most. This data may be used to help optimize our websites and make them easier for you to navigate. These cookies are also used to let affiliates know if you came to one of our websites from an affiliate and if your visit resulted in the use or purchase of a product or service from us, including details of the product or service purchased. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies you. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.</p>

            <h2>Category 3 — Functionality Cookies</h2>
            <p>These cookies allow our websites to remember choices you make while browsing. For instance, we may store your geographic location in a cookie to ensure that we show you our website localized for your area. We may also remember preferences such as text size, fonts, and other customizable site elements. They may also be used to keep track of what featured products or videos have been viewed to avoid repetition. The information these cookies collect will not personally identify you, and they cannot track your browsing activity on non-MossLand websites.</p>
